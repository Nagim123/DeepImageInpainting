# DeepImageInpainting
A project to solve the Image Inpainting problem using generative deep neural networks. Essentially, we are trying to predict a masked part of the image based on the entire context of the image.
## Examaple
You can try our current models on collab.
1. Vanilla AE
2. Pixel CNN (Not working right now)
3. Unet
